# DQN-Deep-Learning
Reinforcement Learning methods using Convolutional Neural Networks as input


To train the net, launch the file and press 0.
For testing, press 1(due to the limitation in the data space on github, i couldn't load the trained weights. You will need to train the net from yourself)
